# PWA in React
## This is testing & practicing project for React PWA

To create an brand new PWA project using `create-react-app` we can use the template. like:

```sh
npx create-react-app pwa-project --template cra-template-pwa-typescript  
```

To check the setup it's need to build the project. To build run the command:

```sh
yarn build
```

We can use the `serve` package to serve our local host. In this case, we need other package name `serve`:

```sh
npm install --global serve
```
It's time to run the build version using serve. The command is:

```sh
serve -s build
```
